## Hardware & Software

* [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/?resellerType=home) 
**! Model 3B+ has been chosen because it's the last version of the pi that can run 16.04 !** 
	* [lubuntu 16.04](https://releases.ubuntu-mate.org/archived/xenial/armhf/)  
	**! Xenial 16.04 has been chosen because ROS Kinetic only supports 15.10 and 16.04 !**
	* [ROS Kinetic (desktop-full)](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) 
	**! ROS Kinetic has been chosen because it's the most used version of ROS !**
	
## Planning

* Robotis Mini
	* buy
