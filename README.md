## Hardware & Software

* [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/?resellerType=home) 
**! Model 3B+ has been chosen because it's the last version of the pi that can run 16.04 !** 
	* [Ubuntu 16.04](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html)  
	**! Official Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 didn't boot on the Pi 3B+ (boot Freeze)...
	Raspbian image with pre-installed ROS from Robotis didn't work (non-installable ROS packages) ...
	Eventually I found an image made by Ubiquity Robotics which is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and has ROS Kinetic pre-installed + it runs on the Pi 4B!**
	* [ROS Kinetic (desktop-full)](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) 
	**! ROS Kinetic has been chosen because it's the most used version of ROS !**
	
## Planning

* Robotis Mini
	* buy
	* build
	* test max load (weight)
	* 3d print RPi mount

* IMU MPU-6050
	* buy
	* install on OpenCM9.04

* Raspberry Camera
	* buy
	* install on Pi

* Basic software Setup
	* Implement ROS on OpenCM9.04
		* publish all info from servos,IMU,raspberry
		* subcribe to get positions for servos
	* implement OpenCV on Pi with camera
